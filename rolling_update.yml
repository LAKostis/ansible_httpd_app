# This playbook does a rolling update for all webservers serially (one at a time).
# Change the value of serial: to adjust the number of server to be updated.
#
# The three roles that apply to the webserver hosts will be applied: common,
# base-apache, and web. So any changes to configuration, package updates, etc,
# will be applied as part of the rolling update process.
